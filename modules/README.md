Modules are in beta! Any feedback is appreciated, from both users & developers!

## Introduction

While DiSky is compiled and based on the JDA library, some other features from Discord need another library. This is where **Modules** enter the game;

These are JARS that can be added into DiSky's module folder, adding syntax related to Discord.

Modules were also meant for others to contribute to DiSky easily, but adding new features from other libraries, and cover all that Discord can offer us!

## Installation

It almost works like plugins. When the server starts with DiSky for the first time, a folder `/plugins/DiSky/modules/` is created. Simply put the module's JARS here, and restart your server.

You can take a look at the enabled & loaded modules through the `/disky modules` command.
